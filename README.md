# Movie Recommendation with Association Rules (Netflix)

This repository contains a movie recommendation model based on association rules, implemented in R using the MovieLens dataset.

## Project Overview

This project applies association rules to build a personalized movie recommendation system based on user behavior. Using the MovieLens (ml-latest-small) dataset, which includes user ratings for thousands of movies, the Apriori algorithm is applied to identify frequent co-viewing patterns.

The model filters movies rated 4 stars or higher and generates recommendations of up to 5 new titles per user without relying on demographic data, solely based on rating patterns.

The workflow covers:

- Data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL)  
- Filtering and preparation of transactions  
- Generation of association rules using Apriori  
- Visualization of rules (graph and support-confidence plots)  
- Movie recommendation function based on user watched movies  

## Technologies and Libraries Used

- R  
- tidyverse  
- arules

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository  
2. Open the RMarkdown file
